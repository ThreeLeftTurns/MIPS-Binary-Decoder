# MIPS-Binary-Decoder
This project decodes MIPS assembly into readable MIPS assembly language

Written in C 
The intent of this project is to provide the terminal with 32 bit assembly and is then decoded back into readable MIPS assembly language. 

This project has been tested using open source MARS MIPS simulator 

The instruction types that are supported are add, addi, sub, beq, bne, slt, j, jr, sll, srl, lw, sw.
